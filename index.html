            This website features the projects I have completed. 
        </h2>
        <body>
            <p> I created this website from scratch. I have personally wrote the code myself to feature my projects more in-depth. 
                If you are here I presume you to be a recruiter, client or other interested party who found the link through my resume. 
                I appreciate the time you took to visit my website and hope you will appreciate a more at ease writing style. 
                Resumes are excellent for quickly analyzing an applicant but the standardization can stifle creativity and make it difficult to gauge important soft skills, such as communication. 
                Please recognize this has been developed with a desktop or laptop experience in mind.
                While it should work properly even on mobile devices, I do not have the capability to extensively test the site. 
            </p>
            <p> I have designed this website by using the waterfall approach to development.
                This approach relies on initial research.
                I chose this method over the agile method, which is often preferred by organizations. 
                Agile enjoys a variety of perks such as live and quick feedback. 
                However this method relies on user-feedback and updates to the website. 
                As this website will not gain as much traction as one used by a large business entity I decided to employ the waterfall design philosophy.

        <p> I have been further learning about concepts related to both data and computer science through books at my local library. 
            This has given me a solid foundation in both fields and improved my programming skill significantly.
            These books have taught me about concepts such as time complexity, data structures, and optimization. 
            Additionally, I have taken on work as a data analyst that has given me practical experience in the data field.
            I passionately enjoy this work and always look for ways to dive in deeper.
        </p>
        <p> This website has become it's own project for me.
            Before creating this website I knew nothing of HTML and CSS. 
            In 1 week I have created and designed the entire website along with the accompanying webpages.
            This was accomplished by self-study through books. 
            I look forward to increasing my knowledge further.
            I encourage you to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.
