            Applying another's dataset
        </h2>
        <body>
            <p> I explored the CDC website for datasets that I found interesting and may be applicable in a business situation.
                You could consider this project a mock version of designing a report for a healthcare company.
                I wanted to consider what types of data a healthcare company would find interesting.
                My approach to my first project was based around gathering my own data and evaluating it.
                This project revolved around evaluating another person's dataset and deciding which data is relevant for the healthcare company.
            </p>
            <p> This project helped to solidify my talents in Excel and Power BI.
                Additionally it increased my efficiency when researching a project and ways to find appropriate data.
                Reading through someone else's research and understanding their dataset is a talent that takes honing.

        <p> <strong> What I would have done differently:</strong>
            Hindsight is always 20/20 and after completing the project I would have changed a few minor things. 
            The main issue I ran into was a lack of knowledge on Power Query. 
            The way coordinates were listed in the dataset was that they are in the same cell, which didn't play nice with Power Query and required separation.
            Most were approximately the same length and as such I decided to use a formula called "right text split" and cleaned up the ones that had longer/shorter length manually.
            This process took approximately 15 minutes - which doesn't sound horrible but it was inefficient and tedious. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I later learned how to apply delimiters in Excel and Power BI to break a text in half by a certain text parameter such as "," "/" "-" etc.
            The coordinates were separated by a comma.
            I could have simply applied a delimiter of "," and had the coordinates in two separate columns, no matter if they were differing lengths.
            Instead of taking 15 minutes, it would have taken seconds using this delimiter approach.
        </p>

                Summary
            </h3>
            <p><strong> In short</strong>, this project taught me how to evaluate others datasets and use it for a business's interests.
                It helped strength my ability in both Excel and Power BI.
                It showed me a practical use for delimiters, a lesson I haven't forgotten.
