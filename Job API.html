            Applying the toolkit of a data analyst
        </h2>
        <body>
            <p> I designed an API program to scrape data from the web.
                The API I created applied both Pandas and Openpyxl libraries in Python. 
                It gathered a variety of data on job postings within a 100 mile radius of my location.
                I ran the API program manually everyday at approximately the same time for exactly 14 days.
                These results were then automatically stored in an Excel file.
                I imported these results into Power BI and began an analysis of the dataset which contained 81 results.
                From this point, I used this project to showcase my abilities in statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project informed me of expectations for the types of business a data analyst works for, years of experience, salary expectations and technology requirements in my area.
                I garnered knowledge on the idiosyncrasies in data analyst positions.
                This knowledge has directly benefited me in interviews and job search. 
                Shortly after it's completion I landed an internship working as a data analyst.
                Additionally, the knowledge gained on Python, Power BI, Excel, and the entire extract, transform, and load processes, has proven to be invaluable.

        <p> <strong> What I would have done differently:</strong>
            Hindsight is always 20/20 and after completing the project I would have changed a few minor things. 
            I believe the most glaring issue was the fact I ran the program manually. 
            I have learned since the project on how to automate this process further without me having to turn on my computer.
            This can be done using cloud technology.
            This would have made the results more consistent and run exactly every 24 hours.
            Additionally, I would have applied a different over the library of Openpyxl. 
            NumPy is more widely used within the data community and understanding this library earlier would have made things far easier for me.

            <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Summary</h3>
            <p><strong> In short</strong>, the experience can be summarized as an extremely fruitful endeavor in teaching myself concepts, tools, technology and practical application of data analysis. 
            With what I know now, I would have redesigned the project slightly but the foundation I gained was well worth it.
